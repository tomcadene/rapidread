### Description
This repository contains a JavaScript implementation for a "Bionic Reading" mode toggle feature. The script enhances text readability by making parts of each word bold based on their length. This feature can be toggled on and off via a button, and the user's preference is saved in localStorage.

### Features
- Bionic Reading Mode: Highlights parts of words to improve readability.
- Toggle Button: Easily enable or disable Bionic Reading mode with a single click.
- Local Storage: Remembers the user's preference even after the page is reloaded.

### Usage
